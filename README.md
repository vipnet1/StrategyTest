# StrategyTest
I tried to create a strategy game-like system of moving, building and controlling the animals.

Made using C++ and OpenGL Version 3.3(thats also the version required to run the app - 3.3 or more).

The project is around 500 MB so i uploaded only essential files, the dependencies i used: GLFW, GLEW, GLM, ASSIMP, irrKlang, freetype32, stb_image.h file.

To run project run GameOpenGL.exe file.

CONTROLS
move mouse to screen boundaries to move. Use W&S keys to change field of view. Click on some animal at the bottom to spawn it. Click the mouse(left click) and drag to create area where
animals will be selected, and then right click where you want them to move. You can also switch to buildings and place them at the bottom menu.
BACKSPACE to return field of view to initial state, ESCAPE to exit the app.
There is also a minimap at the bottom right side. You can see the selected animals there.

Thats only a one game/graphics project from those that I have created. I put it here to show that i have got some experience with C/C++.
